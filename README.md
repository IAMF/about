About the IAM Foundation

The Industrial Arts and Method Foundation (IAMF) is a State of Florida-based foundation that promotes innovation in industrial design education and provides scholarships to cover tuition and related expenses to students enrolled in programs for industrial design.

About Industrial Arts and Method

We chose the phrase “industrial arts and method” to capture the essence of a unique design process utilized at schools supported by the Foundation. Specifically, we take inputs from both industry and the arts and apply a design methodology to elicit both far-reaching idea generation and tangible solutions.
